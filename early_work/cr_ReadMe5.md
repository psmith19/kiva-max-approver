# Problem Statement/Background:

More than 1.7 billion people around the world are unbanked and canâ€™t access the financial services they need. Kiva is an international nonprofit, founded in 2005 in San Francisco, with a mission to expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive. They do this by crowdfunding loans and unlocking capital for the underserved, improving the quality and cost of financial services, and addressing the underlying barriers to financial access around the world.

We aim to help Kiva borrowers maximize their likelihood of getting crowdfunded by identifying the key factors that predict a successful loan. We will build a model that predicts the probability that a prospective loan application will be funded, and, where necessary, offer recommendations to strengthen that application.

# Executive Summary:

The opener:

- More Kiva info
The coolest fact about Kiva is that it bridges the gap between people who need and a people who want to give. Crowdfunding underserved people has his benefits for both lender and loanee; application success is essential.   

The need:

- Include why Kenya..
I noticed that you guys don't have a recommender article or anything that makes recommendations about what makes an application more likely to be successful. We believe that providing the applicant with recommendations about what makes an application succesful will increase the amount of visitors to the website. Such Recommendations can really set Kiva apart from the competitors and help Kiva become the number one source of crowdfunding which have many positive social and capital gains.

The solution:

Lucky for Kiva, Machine Learning is a thing. Machine Learning is a technique based on training algorithms with data. The models increasingly become better at predicting a target variable(Funded vs non-funded applications). By taking the data you've provided us we plan on creating a model that will predict whether a given application is successful or not. After training the model we'll extract the top variables the model is using to predict whether an application will be successful or not. These are the very variables we will be recommending the article be based on. 

The evidence:

- nlp/numeric evidence
